				<h2>What is&nbsp;an&nbsp;NFT token?</h2>
				<p>NFT is&nbsp;a&nbsp;non-fungible token, meaning that a&nbsp;single token cannot be&nbsp;divided or&nbsp;replaced by&nbsp;another. In&nbsp;the case of&nbsp;RobotosTRON NFT is&nbsp;a&nbsp;token that proves your ownership on&nbsp;TRON blockchain regarding certain Robot that you have.</p>
				<p>A&nbsp;non-fungible token is&nbsp;a&nbsp;new generation blockchain token that guarantees a&nbsp;proved ownership.</p>
				<h2>Why do&nbsp;I need an&nbsp;NFT token?</h2>
				<p>NFT in&nbsp;2021&nbsp;is just like Bitcoin in&nbsp;2011&nbsp;if you like. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;still the very first steps off mass adoption, however famous artists, celebrities and auctions like Sotheby’s and Christie’s are already playing an&nbsp;active role in this area.</p>
				<p>We&nbsp;bring the initial minting and give you a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;resell all NFTs on&nbsp;the secondary market with a&nbsp;valuable profit. You will be&nbsp;the very first owner and grab all profit from selling.</p>
				<p>Holding a&nbsp;ROBOTRON NFT token also means that your ownerships confirms by the TRON blockchain smart contract.</p>
				<h2>What is&nbsp;the minting price?</h2>
				<p>The minting price is&nbsp;fixed at&nbsp;350&nbsp;TRX for the public sale until December&nbsp;31.</p>
				<h2>How can&nbsp;I get airdrops?</h2>
				<p>Airdrops are divided into 4&nbsp;different drops: Bored Ape Kennel Tron Club, Lazy Lions, unique Party Ape Club and Secret NFT. If you have minted some Robotos until the&nbsp;31st&nbsp;of&nbsp;December&nbsp;2021 you will receive 4&nbsp;free airdrops for every minted NFT. The snapshot of all accounts will be made on the&nbsp;1st&nbsp;of&nbsp;January&nbsp;2022 at&nbsp;0:00 GMT. Airdrops will be made during the 1Q 2022.</p>
				<h2>How do&nbsp;I sell my&nbsp;new NFTs?</h2>
				<p>All our NFTs are already linked to&nbsp;the Uswap Market Place so&nbsp;are able to&nbsp;sell your NFT right after the minting. Meanwhile, our NFTs are being added to&nbsp;other market places.</p>
